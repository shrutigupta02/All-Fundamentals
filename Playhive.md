## Line by line dissection:
#### Developed a dynamic, cross-platform web application for classic games like Tic-Tac-Toe and 2048 using the MERN stack.
1. **"What makes your application 'dynamic'?"**
    - **They're testing**: Do you understand what dynamic means in web development?
    - **Your Answer**: _"The game states update in real-time as users interact - when you make a move in 2048, the board immediately reflects the changes without page refresh. The application responds to user input dynamically through React's state management."_
2. **"How did you ensure cross-platform compatibility?"**
    - **They're testing**: Understanding of responsive design and device compatibility
    - **Your Answer**: _"I used Tailwind CSS for responsive design and implemented touch event handling for mobile devices. The games work on both desktop (keyboard input) and mobile (touch/swipe gestures)."_
3. **"Walk me through the game implementations - how did you build 2048 and Tic-Tac-Toe from scratch?"**
    - **They're testing**: Your actual coding ability and problem-solving skills
    - **Your Answer**: Focus on your game logic - the swipe functions, win detection algorithms, etc.

#### Implemented Firebase Authentication and form management with Formik/Yup for robust input validation.

4. **"How does Firebase Authentication integrate with your application?"**
    - **They're testing**: Understanding of authentication flow and frontend implementation
    - **Your Answer**: _"I implemented Firebase Authentication on the frontend using Firebase SDK. It handles user login, registration, and session management with secure token generation. Users can sign in using email/password, and Firebase maintains their authentication state across browser sessions.
  5. **"Show me how you implemented form validation with Formik and Yup for Firebase forms"**
    - **They're testing**: Integration of form libraries with Firebase authentication
    - i used formik to provide me with ready-to-use forms that handle state changes in input values without explicit coding for react hooks like setUsername, setPassword. i used yup to validate email addresses, phone numbers to avoid getting invalid inputs like phone numbers less than 10 digits or email addresses with wrong format
  6. **"How do you handle authentication state management in React with Firebase?"**
    - **They're testing**: Frontend authentication flow and React integration
    - **Your Answer**: "I use Firebase's onAuthStateChanged listener in a useEffect hook to monitor authentication status. This allows React components to automatically update when users log in or out.
#### Created scalable backend with Node.js + Express.js, and used MongoDB for persistent game/user data storage.
7. **"What makes your backend 'scalable'?"**
    - **They're testing**: Do you understand scalability concepts?
    - A scalable database can handle increasing workloads of data, transactions, and users without sacrificing performance or reliability
    - "Making an API call on every single move, especially in a fast-paced game, is inefficient. To make it scalable and reduce server load, I implemented **debouncing** on the front-end. Instead of saving the state immediately, the application waits until the user has paused for a moment—say, for 1.5 seconds—and then sends a single API call to save the latest game state. This drastically cuts down on network traffic and is much more efficient.
    - apart from this, my database is deployed on mongoDB atlas, which provides easy methods to scale vertically and horizontally as my application and traffic would grow.
  8. **"Show me your Express.js server structure and explain the middleware you used"**
    - **They're testing**: Understanding of Express concepts
    - **Your Answer**: 
      i have used cors in my backend to facilitate connection with the frontend made in react, i have created an express app, and defined routes for setting user data storage, getting game metadata from db and one for storing game state 
  9. **"How do you handle errors in your Express application?"**
    - **They're testing**: Error handling practices
    - answ: to handle the errors i have implemented try-catch blocks in every route so any runtime error does not disrupt the application. apart from this i have used HTTP status codes like 200 for success and 500 for internal server error
  10. **"What RESTful principles did you follow in your API design?"**
      - my application executes separation of concerns between the client and the server, the client sends a requests and the server processes it and responds, my application uses appropriate HTTP methods, get, post alongside returning appropriate status codes
11. **"Explain your MongoDB schema design"**
    - They're testing: Database design skills and understanding of NoSQL principles
    - i have created three schemas, one User model that contains info about all users registered on my application it stores attributes like their chosen display name, phone numbers, favorite games etc, and one for games metadata it includes info about all games like their names, description 

#### Built frontend using React.js and Tailwind CSS


##### Game logic: 
###### 2048:
created swipe functions for swipe left, right, up and down that facilitate the trigger of swipe like motion in game board with the use of key press and merge tiles accordingly

initialised a 2d array as a hook to simulate game grid and track changes in the grid at different events of swipes

wrote functions like 
- getScore which would compute the scores based on values in the grid
- initialise which starts a new game with a fresh new grid
- addNumber which adds a random number tile every swipe
- gameOver which checks if there are any possible merge available by any swipes, if not then it sets the gameOver state value to true which terminates the game
- swipe up, down, left, right that are called when up, down etc etc keys are pressed

###### Tic Tac Toe:
created a board component and a main tictactoe component that handles game logic and display
created the following functions:
- generate squares that generates a 3x3 matrix with initial 0 value
- update square that uses setState for board every time a player makes a move
- check for winner that checks if any player has won using a while loop with conditions inside
- reset game that restarts a new game

##### Description:
What is PlayHive?
PlayHive is a web-based gaming platform that hosts classic games like 2048 and Tic-Tac-Toe. Think of it as a mini-arcade where users can play games, register accounts, and have their progress tracked.

Technical Stack Deep Dive

###### Frontend: React.js + Tailwind CSS

What You Built:
Games Page: Main landing page that displays available games in categories
Individual Game Components: Separate React components for 2048 and Tic-Tac-Toe
Common Components: NavBar, Footer, Background, CardSlider, GameDeck

Key React Concepts You Used:
Functional Components: All your components use modern function syntax
Hooks: useState for game state, useEffect for API calls
Props: Passing game data down to child components
Component Composition: Breaking UI into reusable pieces

###### Backend: Node.js + Express.js

What Your server.js Does:
Express Concepts You Implemented:
Middleware: Functions that run before route handlers (cors, json parsing)
Route Handlers: Functions that respond to specific HTTP requests
Error Handling: Try-catch blocks with appropriate status codes
Database Integration: Using Mongoose models to interact with MongoDB

###### Database: MongoDB

Your Data Models:
Games Model: Stores metadata about available games (name, description, etc.)
User Model: Stores additional user data like chosen display name, favorite games, contact number, etc.

MongoDB Concepts:

Collections: Like tables in SQL (you have Games and User collections)
Documents: Individual records (each user is a document)
Schemas: Structure defined by your Mongoose models
CRUD Operations: Create (POST /user), Read (GET /games)
SCALING: debouncing which is done by lodash npm package
###### Authentication: Firebase

What You Integrated:
Firebase Authentication for user login/registration
Though your current backend shows basic user storage in MongoDB
Firebase handles the complex auth logic (password hashing, sessions, etc.)


Game Logic Breakdown
2048 Game Implementation
**Game Flow:**
1. User presses arrow key or swipes
2. Corresponding swipe function called
3. Board state updated with new positions
4. addNumber() adds new tile
5. getScore() calculates new score
6. gameOver() checks if game should end
7. React re-renders with new state

#### **How to Answer Common Questions**

#### **"Explain your component structure"**

_"I organized my React app with a clear hierarchy. The Games page is the main container that fetches data and renders game categories. Each game (2048, Tic-Tac-Toe) is a separate component with its own logic. I have shared components like NavBar and Footer that are reused across pages. The GameDeck component handles the layout of game cards."_

#### **"How do you handle API calls?"**

_"I use axios to make HTTP requests. In my Games component, I have a useEffect hook that runs on component mount to fetch available games from my backend. I handle both success and error cases with .then() and .catch() methods."_

#### **"Explain your Express.js setup"**

_"My Express server is straightforward - I set up middleware for JSON parsing and CORS, connect to MongoDB, and define two main routes. The GET /games route fetches all games from the database, and POST /user handles user registration with proper error handling."_

#### **"How do you store game state?"**

_"For both games, I use React's useState hook to manage state locally. The 2048 game uses a 2D array to represent the grid, while Tic-Tac-Toe uses a 3x3 matrix. State updates trigger re-renders to show the current game state."_

#### **"What about form validation?"**

_"I integrated Formik for form state management and Yup for validation schemas. This handles user input validation for registration forms, including email format, required fields, and password requirements."_

#### "Why did you use Firebase for authentication but MongoDB Atlas for your database? Why not use Firestore?"
    
- **Your Perfect Answer:** "That was a deliberate architectural decision. I chose **Firebase Authentication** because it's a specialized, secure, and incredibly fast solution for user identity management. It handles everything from social logins to password resets out of the box, which let me focus on my application's core logic."
    
    "For my application's data—like user profiles and game statistics—I wanted the power and flexibility of MongoDB's querying capabilities and the robust ecosystem around the MERN stack, specifically with Mongoose. Using **MongoDB Atlas** gave me that flexibility and a clear, simple path for scaling my data layer as the app grows. This **'best-of-breed'**approach allowed me to use the best specialized service for each part of my application: Firebase for identity and Atlas for data."

## **Technical Deep Dive Questions (Very Likely)**

### **17. "Can you walk me through your project's folder structure?"**

**What they want to see**: Organization and project structure understanding

### **18. "How does data flow from your database to the frontend?"**
request response structure
**Step-by-step Flow:**

1. **Frontend Initiation**: When the Games component mounts, useEffect triggers an axios GET request to `http://localhost:1234/games`
2. **Express Route Handler**: The server receives the request at the `/games` endpoint
3. **Database Query**: Express calls `Games.find()` which uses Mongoose to query MongoDB
4. **Data Retrieval**: MongoDB returns all documents from the Games collection
5. **Response Processing**: Express wraps the data in JSON format and sends it back with appropriate status codes
6. **Frontend Update**: Axios receives the response, and while I currently log it to console, it would populate the game cards

### **19. "What happens when a user makes a move in 2048?"**

**What they want to see**: Step-by-step technical explanation
