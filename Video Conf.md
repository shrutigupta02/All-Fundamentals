## Technical Architecture Questions

### Explain the overall architecture of your application

• Frontend: React.js with modern hooks and context API for state management • Backend: Node.js with Express.js framework for RESTful API endpoints • Database: MongoDB Atlas for user data, chat history, and session management • Real-time Communication: Socket.io for bidirectional WebSocket connections • Cloud Infrastructure: AWS for hosting with scalable deployment architecture

### How does Socket.io work in your application?

• Establishes WebSocket connections for real-time bidirectional communication between clients and server • Handles video streaming data transmission and instant messaging in real-time • Manages room-based connections allowing multiple users to join specific conference sessions • Provides event-driven architecture for connection management, user joining/leaving, and message broadcasting • Offers fallback mechanisms to HTTP long-polling if WebSocket connections fail

### Walk me through the video calling flow

• User authenticates and joins a meeting room through the React frontend • Socket.io establishes WebSocket connection and adds user to specific room namespace • WebRTC peer-to-peer connections are negotiated through Socket.io signaling server • Video/audio streams are exchanged directly between participants using WebRTC • Socket.io continues to handle chat messages and room management events

## Authentication & Security Questions

### How did you implement JWT authentication?

• Created secure login/register endpoints that generate JWT tokens upon successful authentication • Implemented password hashing using bcrypt before storing in MongoDB • Used React AuthContext to manage authentication state across the application • Protected routes with middleware that validates JWT tokens on every request • Implemented token refresh mechanism to maintain secure sessions

### What security measures did you implement?

• JWT-based stateless authentication with secure token generation and validation • Password encryption using bcrypt with salt rounds for secure storage • Protected API routes with authentication middleware • CORS configuration to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests • Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks • Secure environment variable management for sensitive configuration data

### How do you handle user sessions and authorization?

• JWT tokens store user information and permissions in encoded format • React AuthContext provides centralized session state management across components • Automatic token validation on protected routes and API calls • Role-based authorization controls for different user permission levels • Secure logout functionality that clears tokens and invalidates sessions

## Database & Backend Questions

### Why did you choose MongoDB for this project?

• NoSQL flexibility perfect for storing varied user data, chat messages, and session information • Excellent JSON integration with Node.js and JavaScript ecosystem • MongoDB Atlas provides cloud hosting with built-in security and scalability • Schema flexibility allows easy adaptation as project requirements evolve • Strong performance for read-heavy operations like chat history and user profiles

### How did you structure your MongoDB collections?

• Users collection: stores authentication data, profiles, and user preferences • Rooms/Sessions collection: manages active and historical meeting data • Messages collection: stores chat history with timestamps and room references • Used proper indexing on frequently queried fields like userIds and roomIds • Implemented data relationships using references for normalized data structure

### Explain your Express.js API structure

• RESTful API design with clear endpoints for authentication, users, rooms, and messages • Middleware chain including authentication, CORS, body parsing, and error handling • Modular route organization separating concerns (auth routes, user routes, room routes) • Centralized error handling with proper HTTP status codes and error messages • Input validation middleware ensuring data integrity before database operations

## Frontend & React Questions

### How did you manage state in your React application?

• Used React AuthContext for global authentication state management • Local component state with useState for component-specific data • Custom hooks for reusable stateful logic like Socket.io connection management • Props drilling minimized through context API for frequently accessed data • Controlled components for form inputs with proper validation

### How did you handle real-time updates in the UI?

• Socket.io client integration for receiving real-time events from server • React useEffect hooks to listen for Socket.io events and update component state • Real-time message updates in chat interface without page refreshes • Live participant list updates when users join or leave meetings • Instant UI feedback for connection status and user actions

### What React patterns and best practices did you follow?

• Functional components with hooks instead of class components • Custom hooks for Socket.io connection and authentication logic • Component composition and reusability for UI elements • Proper dependency arrays in useEffect to prevent unnecessary re-renders • Error boundaries for graceful error handling and user experience

## Cloud & Deployment Questions

### How did you deploy this application on AWS?

• Used AWS EC2 instances for hosting the Node.js backend application • Configured security groups and networking for proper access control • Set up environment variables for production configuration • Implemented MongoDB Atlas integration for cloud database connectivity • Used AWS load balancing and auto-scaling for handling traffic spikes

### What AWS services did you use and why?

• EC2 for compute resources with scalable virtual server instances • S3 potentially for storing static assets and file uploads • CloudFront for content delivery and improved global performance • Route 53 for domain management and DNS routing • IAM for access control and security policy management

### How do you handle scalability in your application?

• Horizontal scaling through AWS auto-scaling groups based on traffic • Database optimization with proper indexing and query optimization • Socket.io clustering and Redis adapter for handling multiple server instances • CDN integration for static asset delivery and reduced server load • Load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple application instances
